--Discussion-- 

Genetic algorithms are a subset of algorithms that are based on genetic principles. More 
exactly, “genes” evolve through crossing and mutation over numerous rounds. For example, 
2 genes crossover, resulting in the production of a new gene having some features from one 
gene and the rest from the other. The new gene is then subjected to mutation. In this 
assignment, the genetic algorithm was fed  5 models as input. To get the best results for each 
Traveling Salesman Problem, the genetic algorithm was run  5 times with varying 
parameters. This assignment used two sorts of models which are cities that were located at 
random spots and cities that were circular in shape. For model 1 and 5 , the genetic algorithm 
parameters were 70 population size. For model 3 and 4, the genetic algorithm parameters 
were 60 population size. For model 2, the genetic algorithm parameters were 50 population 
size. 

Maximum Number of Iteration (Maxit)

In this assignment, the number of iterations ranged from low to large in order to observe the 
differences. The most notable effect of Maxit is that the higher the number of iterations, the 
longer the algorithm takes to perform. However, the results of model 2, 3,4 and 5 show that a 
small number of iterations may result in less efficient outputs. As a result, additional 
iterations were required to achieve better outcomes. 
Population Size (nPop)  
The findings indicate that a larger population size leads to a better outcome. We can see that 
results with a larger population tend to produce more productive and efficient results in fewer 
iterations. This is due to the fact that chromosomal diversity rises as population size rises. As 
a result, the algorithm would have more options to choose from when determining which 
route is the least expensive cost. 

Crossover Percentage (pc) 

The crossover percentage was fixed in this assignment since it has a similar influence on the 
population size. Since population size regulates the potential of chromosome crossover, it has 
an impact on the number of offspring produced. 

Number of offspring (nc/nm)  

This parameter is proportional to the size of the population and the percentage of crossover. 
As a result, the effect almost equals the effect of population size and crossover percentage. 

Selection Pressure (beta)  

These parameters were not be used in the algorithm because the chromosomal selection was 
absolutely random. 

Conclusion 

In the nutshell, the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) can be solved using a genetic 
algorithm which is popular Artificial Intelligence technique. Changing the parameters' values 
will change the outcome. As a result, the parameters should be fine-tuned to achieve the best 
outcomes.
